    - NoneType 
    - Numeric Types 
    - Sequences 

## Data Types in Python 

A datatype represents the type of data stored in a variable or memory. The datatypes which can be created by the programmers are called *User-defined* datatypes. 

## Built-in datatypes 

The datatypes which are already in Python language are called *Built-in* datatypes. The built-in datatypes are of five types:

- NoneType 
- Numeric Types 
- Sequences 
- Sets 
- Mappings

### NoneType 

In Python, the ‘*NonType*’ datatype represents an object that does not contain any value. In Python, we store ‘None’ to represent an empty object and its datatype is considered as ‘*NoneType*’. 

### Numeric Types 

The numeric types represent numbers. There are three sub types: 

- int

    > The int datatype represents an integer number. An integer number is a number without any decimal point number. For example, `200`, `-200`, `0`, `9888998700`, etc., are treated as integer number.

- float

  > The float datatype represents an floating-point number. An floating-point number is a number that contains a decimal point. For example, `0.5`, `-5.3040`, `200.400`, `0.001`, etc., are treated as floating-point number.

- complex 
    > The complex number is a number that is written in the form of `a+bj`. An floating-point number is a number that contains a decimal point. For example, `0.5`, `-5.3040`, `200.400`, `0.001`, etc., are treated as floating-point number.

### Sequences 

### Sets 

### Mappings
