## Introduction to C

C is a programming language developed at AT & T's Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.

C was initially developed to create **UNIX Operating System**.

## Features of C language

The most important features of C language are

1. **Simplicity**
2. **Portability**
3. **Speed and Efficiency**
4. **Rich Library Support**
5. **Low-Level Access**
6. **Structured Programming**
7. **Extensibility**
8. **Flexibility**
9. **Modularity**
10. **Middle-level language**

These features are defined below: -

1. **Simplicity** : C has a strightfoward and simple syntax, making it easier to learn and use.

2. **Portability** : Programs written in C can be executed on different machines with minimal or no modifications. This makes it highly portable.

3. **Speed and Efficiency** : C is a compiled language, and its low-level capabilities makes it extremely fast and efficient, especially for system-level programming.

4. **Rich Library Support** : C provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries for various tasks, such as handling input/output, string manipulation, and math operations.

5. **Low-Level Access** : C allows direct access to memory using pointers, which is crucial for system programming and tasks like hardware interaction.

6. **Structured Programming** : C supports structured programming paradigrms like functions, loops, and decision-making constructs, making code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

7. **Extensibility** : C allows developers to add features by writing their own libraries or using external ones, making it highly extensible.

8. **Flexibility** : C is highly flexible and be used for various applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, game development, and more.

9. **Modularity** : Using functions, you can break your code into smaller, manageable modules, promoting reusability and clarity.

10. **Middle-level language** : C is often referred to as a middle-level language because it combines the features of both low-level and high-level languages, making it suitable for hardware-level programming as well as applications development.
