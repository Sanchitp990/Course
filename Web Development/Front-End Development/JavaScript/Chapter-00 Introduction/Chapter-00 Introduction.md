## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language for the web. JavaScript was developed by "[*Brendan Eich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)" in May 1995 while he was an engineer at "[*Netscape Communications Corporation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape)". He created the first version of javascript in just ten days to add interactivity to web pages.

The language was intailly named "_Mocha_" then renamed "_LiveScript_" and finally "_JavaScript_" as a marketing stratagy to capitalize on the popularity of the "[*Java programming language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))" developed by "[*Sun Microsystems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems)".
