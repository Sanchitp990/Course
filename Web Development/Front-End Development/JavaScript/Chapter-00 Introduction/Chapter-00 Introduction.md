## Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a scripting language for the web. JavaScript was developed by "[*Brendan Eich*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich)" in May 1995 while he was an engineer at "[*Netscape Communications Corporation*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape)". He created the first version of javascript in just ten days to add interactivity to web pages.

The language was intailly named "_Mocha_" then renamed "_LiveScript_" and finally "_JavaScript_" as a marketing stratagy to capitalize on the popularity of the "[*Java programming language*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))" developed by "[*Sun Microsystems*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems)".

### Does Java and JavaScript are same?

No, Java and JavaScript are not the same; they are two completely different programming languages with different purpose.

### There are some key differences of Java and JavaScript

**__Java__** is a "statically typed" programming language and it's primarly used for "Enterprise software, Android apps, and server-side backend".

**__JavaScript__** is a "dynamically typed" scripting language and it's primarily used for "Interactive web pages (Frontend), but also backend with node.js".

## Why JavaScript is so popular?

JavaScript is popular because it's the only programming language that runs natively in web browsers, making it essential for creating interactive web experiences. It's also versatile, allowing developers to build both frontend and backend applications, and has a large community and extensive ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.

## Where JavaScript is used?

JavaScript is used in various domains, including:

- **Web Development**: Creating interactive and dynamic web pages.
- **Server-Side Development**: Using Node.js to build scalable backend applications.
- **Mobile App Development**: Building cross-platform mobile apps with frameworks like React Native.
- **Game Development**: Developing browser-based games.
- **Desktop Applications**: Creating desktop apps using frameworks like Electron.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**: Programming smart devices and IoT applications.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing machine learning models with libraries like TensorFlow.js.
- **Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)**: Building web applications that offer a native app-like experience.
- **Browser Extensions**: Developing extensions for web browsers to enhance functionality.
- **Automation and Scripting**: Automating tasks in web browsers and other environments.
