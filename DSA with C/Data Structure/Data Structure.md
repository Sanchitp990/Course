# Data Structure


## Introduction to Data Structure

*<ins>Data Structure</ins> is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.*

**Classification of data structures :-**

**Detailed explanation of the above classification :-**

1. **<ins>Primitive Data Structures</ins>** :-

   These are basic data structures that include *Integers, Float, Character, and Boolean*.

2. **<ins>Non-Primitive Data Structures</ins>** :-

   These are more complex data structures and are futher classified into:

   - **<ins>Linear Data Structures</ins>** :-
  
      *<ins>Linear Data Structure</ins> are those data structures where data elements are arranged linearly or sequentially, where each element is attached to its next as well as previous adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure. Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queues.*

   - **<ins>Non-Linear Data Structures</ins>** :-
  
      *<ins>Non-Linear Data Structures</ins> are those data structures where the placement of data elements is not done linearly or sequentially. Examples: graphs, and trees.*


 - **Array :-** *An array is a collection of items of some data type stored at contiguous (one after another) memory locations.*

There are three main types of Arrays:-

1. One-dimensional Array(1D Array):
2. Multi-dimensional Array(2D or 3D Array):
