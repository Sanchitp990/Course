**These features are defined below: -**

1. **Simplicity** : C has a strightfoward and simple syntax, making it easier to learn and use.

1. **Portability** : Programs written in C can be executed on different machines with minimal or no modifications. This makes it highly portable.

1. **Speed and Efficiency** : C is a compiled language, and its low-level capabilities makes it extremely fast and efficient, especially for system-level programming.

1. **Rich Library Support** : C provides a rich set of built-in functions and libraries for various tasks, such as handling input/output, string manipulation, and math operations.

1. **Low-Level Access** : C allows direct access to memory using pointers, which is crucial for system programming and tasks like hardware interaction.

1. **Structured Programming** : C supports structured programming paradigrms like functions, loops, and decision-making constructs, making code easier to read, debug, and maintain.

1. **Extensibility** : C allows developers to add features by writing their own libraries or using external ones, making it highly extensible.

1. **Flexibility** : C is highly flexible and be used for various applications, including operating systems, embedded systems, game development, and more.

1. **Modularity** : Using functions, you can break your code into smaller, manageable modules, promoting reusability and clarity.

1. **Middle-level language** : C is often referred to as a middle-level language because it combines the features of both low-level and high-level languages, making it suitable for hardware-level programming as well as applications development.
