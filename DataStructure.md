# Data Structure

## 1. What is Data?

Data is a collection of raw, unorganized facts, figures or observations that require processing to become meaningful.

## 2. What is Information?

Information is defined as processed, structured, and organized data that is presented in a meaningful context, making it useful, relevent, and understandable to the person who needs it.

**Difference between Data and Information :-**

| Aspect | Data | Information |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Definition | Raw facts, figures or symbols without meaning. | Processed, organized, and meaningful data. |
| Processing | No processing is done on data. | Data is processed to generate information. |
| Meaning | Data has no clear meaning. | Information has a clear and understandable meaning. |
| Example | "`DLROW OLLEH`" Collection of character | "`HELLO WORLD`" Meaningful Data |
| Form | Unprocessed and unorganized. | Processed, organized and meaningful. |
| Purpose | Cannot be directly used for decision-making | Can be used for decision-making and understanding |

## Introduction to Data Structure

<ins>Data Structure</ins> is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.

**Classification of data structures :-**

**Detailed explanation of the above classification :-**

1. Primitive Data Structure :-
The are basic data structures that include *Integers, Float, Character, and Boolean*.

1. Non-Primitive Data Structure :-
These are more complex data structures and are futher classified into:

   - Linear Data Structure :-
In these data structures, data elements are arranged sequentially. 
Examples: Array, Linked List, Stack, and Queues.

   - Non-Linear Data Structure :-
Here data elements aren't placed in a sequence.
